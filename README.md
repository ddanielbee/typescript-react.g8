A [Giter8][g8] template for a React application with Typescript support.

## Usage

Create it using g8, by running:

`g8 ddanielbee/typescript-react.g8`

Follow the CLI prompts.

## Note on building the app

At one point, you'll be asked if you want to [use_snowpack](https://www.snowpack.dev/). The options are, `yes` or `no`. If you choose yes, the template will use snowpack to build your app, and webpack to produce an optimized build for production. If you choose not to, the template will default to using `webpack` for building and bundling the application.

Default choice is to use webpack, since snowpack is still very experimental.

### With Yarn

`cd <project-name> && yarn`

Once node dependencies are installed, you can start the project's development server with `yarn start` or `yarn start:all`. In `localhost:8080` you'll find a more detailed description of the template.

## With NPM

`cd <project-name> && rm yarn.lock`

It's important to remove yarn.lock, since it won't be necessary when using npm. Afterwards:

`npm install`

This will install dependencies, and create a `package-json.lock` file, which is the npm equivalent to the `yarn.lock` file.

Once node dependencies are installed, you can start the project's development server with `npm run start`. In `localhost:8080` you'll find a more detailed description of the template.

### Note:

The npm script `npm run start:all` won't work out of the box when using npm. To fix this, replace `yarn` by `npm run` in the script inside `package.json`.
